        /*Autoboxing 
         * Autoboxing is the automatic conversion that the Java compiler makes between the primitive types and their corresponding object wrapper classes.
         * For example, converting an int to an Integer, a double to a Double, and so on.
         * Unboxing
         * Unboxing is the reverse process, where the object wrapper class is converted back to its corresponding primitive type.
         * For example, converting an Integer to an int, a Double to a double, and so on.
         * wrapper class
         * Wrapper classes in Java are used to convert primitive data types into objects.
         * Each primitive type has a corresponding wrapper class:
         * int -> Integer
         * double -> Double         
         * boolean -> Boolean
         * char -> Character
         *  byte -> Byte
         * short -> Short
         * long -> Long
         * float -> Float
         * These wrapper classes are part of the java.lang package and provide methods to convert between primitive types and their object representations.
